# quote_machine

Technologies used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (or React if applicable)

Developed a dynamic Quote Machine web application that displays random inspirational quotes with each click. The app fetches quotes from a predefined list (or an API, if applicable) and updates the UI with smooth transitions and color changes for better user experience. Also integrated a “Tweet Quote” button to allow users to share their favorite quotes directly to Twitter. This project helped enhance my skills in DOM manipulation, event handling, and responsive design.
